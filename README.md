# mLingo
Hi there, as our project was growing we decided to move it to private repository as it's not intended to be opensource.

## What is mLingo?
mLingo is smart, beautiful and easy to use application that will make learning fun and simple. Create your own collections of stuff you want to memorize or use ones created by other members of our community. Share your knowledge and integrate with huge community of passionate people.

## When will it be available?
We decided to abandon this project because of lack of time and motivation, this project was too big for us both.
